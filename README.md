## Inspiration

As Swiggy is one of the leading food delivery platforms with more than 100k restaurants listed all around India so I've created this dataset so that people can apply their skills to understand this market in a better manner.

This dataset can help you to answer the following question

1. How many restaurants are listed on Swiggy in India?
